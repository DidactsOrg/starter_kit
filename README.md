# DIDACTS Project Starter Kit

## Background reading

Start with the [Dark Matter direct detection wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Direct_detection) and the [XENON experiments wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XENON).

### XENON

 * [PhD Thesis, Jelle Aalbers](http://astroparticle.rice.edu/teaching/thesis_J_Aalbers.pdf) - Audience is physicists, but is a PhD thesis so a bit more generally written.  This contains an overview of the science, the XENON experiment, and details of the analysis.
 * [MS Thesis, Bart Pelssers](http://astroparticle.rice.edu/teaching/MScThesisPelssers.pdf) - Broader audience and more detail on just position reconstruction.
 * [PhD Thesis, Bart Pelssers](http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1415753&dswid=6384) - The third chapter on position reconstruction explains the position reconstruction method used for XENON1T result.
 * XENON1T papers
   * [Data acquisition system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00819) - Overview of how data is recorded
   * [Signal reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04717) - Overview on what is done to data after it is recorded.
   * [First Results](http://astroparticle.rice.edu/teaching/1705.06655.pdf) - Short paper giving an overview of the analaysis, physicist audience.
   * [Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07051) - Overview of the detector design.
 * Electron emission backgrounds
   * [Investigation of background electron emission in the LUX detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07791.pdf) - Similar detector, thorough study
